# Introduction

In this project I have build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral. When a user submits a URL of an article, the web page then dispalys sentiment analysis returned from MeaningCloud API, based on the contents of the article.

The goal of the project was to give a practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls
